# CodeAlpha_Stock_Prediction
This project aims to predict stock prices using deep learning techniques, specifically LSTM neural networks. LSTM networks are well-suited for time series forecasting due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, making them particularly effective for predicting stock prices which exhibit complex temporal patterns.
